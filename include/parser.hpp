 *  Description:
 *  This application implements a custom version of the `echo` command in C++.
 *  It handles various escape sequences, such as \a (alert), \b (backspace),
 *  \n (newline), \t (tab), etc. It prints the command-line arguments with the
 *  escape sequences interpreted correctly.
 *
 *  Usage: ./echo <string>
 *
 *  The following escape sequences are supported:
 *      \a      : Alert
 *      \b      : Backspace
 *      \c      : Suppress the <newline> that otherwise follows the final argument in the output. All characters following the '\c' in the arguments shall be ignored.
 *      \f      : Form-feed
 *      \n      : Newline
 *      \t      : Tab
 *      \r      : Carriage return
 *      \v      : Vertical tab
 *      \\      : Backslash
 *      \0num   : 8-bit octal value (num)
 *

/**
 * @class Parser
 * @brief A utility class for interpreting and converting escape sequences within input strings.
 *
 * The Parser class provides methods to process strings containing C++-style escape sequences,
 * including both standard escape characters (e.g., `\n`, `\t`) and octal escape sequences (e.g., `\012`).
 *
 * It offers a public interface through `ParseArgument()` that parses and converts all valid escape
 * sequences in a given string into their corresponding ASCII characters.
 *
 * Internally, it uses `ParseEscapeCharacter()` to identify and interpret individual escape codes, and
 * `ParseOctal()` to specifically handle octal escape formats.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * Parser parser;
 * std::string parsed = parser.ParseArgument("Hello\\nWorld\\041");
 * parsed == "Hello\nWorld!"
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Octal escapes must begin with `\0` and contain up to three octal digits (0â€“7).
 *
 * @see Parser::ParseArgument
 * @see Parser::ParseEscapeCharacter
 * @see Parser::ParseOctal

     * as a standard C++ escape code (e.g., `\n`, `\t`, `\0`), it is translated into the corresponding
