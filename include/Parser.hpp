/**
 * @class Parser
 * @brief A utility class for interpreting and converting escape sequences within input strings.
 *
 * The Parser class provides methods to process strings containing C++-style escape sequences,
 * including both standard escape characters (e.g., `\n`, `\t`) and octal escape sequences (e.g., `\012`).
 *
 * It offers a public interface through `ParseArgument()` that parses and converts all valid escape
 * sequences in a given string into their corresponding ASCII characters.
 *
 * Internally, it uses `ParseEscapeCharacter()` to identify and interpret individual escape codes, and
 * `ParseOctal()` to specifically handle octal escape formats.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * Parser parser;
 * std::string parsed = parser.ParseArgument("Hello\\nWorld\\041");
 * // parsed == "Hello\nWorld!"
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Octal escapes must begin with `\0` and contain up to three octal digits (0â€“7).
 *
 * @see Parser::ParseArgument
 * @see Parser::ParseEscapeCharacter
 * @see Parser::ParseOctal

     *
     * This method examines the character at the next index (`next`) of the input string
     * and attempts to interpret it as a valid escape sequence. If the character is recognized
     * as a standard C++ escape code (e.g., `\n`, `\t`, `\0`), it is translated into the corresponding
     * character. Octal sequences starting with `\0` are delegated to the `ParseOctal` method.
     *
     * Supported escape sequences:
     * - `\a` : Alert (bell)
     * - `\b` : Backspace
     * - `\f` : Form feed
     * - `\n` : Newline
     * - `\r` : Carriage return
     * - `\t` : Horizontal tab
     * - `\v` : Vertical tab
     * - `\\` : Backslash
     * - `\0nnn` : Octal escape (handled via `ParseOctal`)
     *
     * If the character following the backslash is not recognized, the method returns an empty string.
     *
     * @param argument The input string that may contain an escape sequence.
     * @return A string containing the corresponding interpreted character, or an empty string if unrecognized.
